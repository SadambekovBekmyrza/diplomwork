        The crested honey buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus), also known as the
        Oriental honey buzzard, is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae.
        Its size ranges from 57 to 60 centimetres (22 to 24 in). The name is
        derived from its diet, which consists mainly of the larvae of bees and
        wasps, extracted from honeycombs. It has several adaptations for this
        diet, including an elongated head for foraging on underground nests and
        a groove in the tongue for feeding on honey. A mass of short, dense
        feathers on the head and neck protect against stinging attacks by social
        wasps. The crested honey buzzard is a year-round resident in Southeast
        Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some birds migrate to Siberia and
        Japan during the summer for breeding. This crested honey buzzard was
        photographed in Mudumalai National Park, India.
